  <h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 1, 2026</p>
<p>PeacePoint (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot;) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the PeacePoint mobile application.</p>
<h2 id="1-our-privacy-promise-no-tracking">1. Our Privacy Promise: No Tracking</h2>
<p>Unlike many apps, <strong>PeacePoint does NOT track you.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We do NOT sell your data.</li>
<li>We do NOT use external analytics to track your behavior (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel).</li>
<li>We do NOT require an account registration (email/password).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-data-we-collect">2. Data We Collect</h2>
<h3 id="a-locally-stored-data-on-your-device-">A. Locally Stored Data (On Your Device)</h3>
<p>The following data is created by you and stored <strong>only on your specific device</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Journal Entries:</strong> Text and audio notes you record.</li>
<li><strong>Checklist Status:</strong> Your progress on daily routines.</li>
<li><strong>Photos:</strong> Images you attach to checklists.</li>
<li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your preferences (theme, haptics, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We do not have access to this data.</strong> If you delete the app, this data is permanently deleted unless you have backed up your device via iCloud/Android Backup.</p>
<h3 id="b-anonymous-purchase-data">B. Anonymous Purchase Data</h3>
<p>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage in-app purchases. When you make a purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>RevenueCat generates a random, anonymous User ID.</li>
<li>We receive a confirmation that &quot;Anonymous User X purchased Lifetime Access.&quot;</li>
<li>We <strong>cannot</strong> link this purchase to your real identity, email, or physical location.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-device-permissions">3. Device Permissions</h2>
<p>The App may request access to certain device features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used strictly to allow you to take photos for your checklists.</li>
<li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> Used to save or retrieve checklist verification photos.</li>
<li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Used <strong>only</strong> if you choose to record an audio note in the Journal.</li>
<li><strong>FaceID/Biometrics:</strong> Used to lock the app locally. We never receive your biometric data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-third-party-services">4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following trusted third-party services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For processing purchase receipts (Privacy standards compliant).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-data-security">5. Data Security</h2>
<p>Since your data is stored locally, it is as secure as your device. We recommend using a device passcode and enabling the &quot;Privacy Vault&quot; feature within the App for extra security.</p>
<h2 id="6-children-s-privacy">6. Children&#39;s Privacy</h2>
<p>PeacePoint is not intended for children under the age of 4. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>
<h2 id="7-changes-to-this-policy">7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date at the top of this policy.</p>
<h2 id="8-contact-us">8. Contact Us</h2>
