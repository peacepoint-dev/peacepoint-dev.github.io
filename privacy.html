  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 1, 2026</p>
<p>PeacePoint (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot;) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the PeacePoint mobile application.</p>
<h2>1. Our Privacy Promise: No Tracking</h2>
<p>Unlike many apps, <strong>PeacePoint does NOT track you.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We do NOT sell your data.</li>
<li>We do NOT use external analytics to track your behavior (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel).</li>
<li>We do NOT require an account registration (email/password).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
<h3>A. Locally Stored Data (On Your Device)</h3>
<p>The following data is created by you and stored <strong>only on your specific device</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Journal Entries:</strong> Text and audio notes you record.</li>
<li><strong>Checklist Status:</strong> Your progress on daily routines.</li>
<li><strong>Photos:</strong> Images you attach to checklists.</li>
<li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your preferences (theme, haptics, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We do not have access to this data.</strong> If you delete the app, this data is permanently deleted unless you have backed up your device via iCloud/Android Backup.</p>
<h3>B. iCloud and Device Backups (iOS)</h3>
<p>If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your iOS device, the following data <strong>may be automatically backed up</strong> to your iCloud account:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SQLite Database:</strong> Contains all your journal entries, mood logs, checklist data, routine settings, and exposure therapy records.</li>
<li><strong>Images:</strong> Photos you&#39;ve attached to checklists for verification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This backup is handled entirely by Apple&#39;s iOS operating system, not by PeacePoint.</li>
<li>We do <strong>not</strong> have access to your iCloud account or backup data.</li>
<li>You control whether backups occur through your device&#39;s Settings &gt; [Your Name] &gt; iCloud &gt; iCloud Backup.</li>
<li>If you restore your device from an iCloud backup, your PeacePoint data will be restored automatically.</li>
<li>iCloud backups are encrypted in transit and stored using strong security methods by Apple.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Android users, similar backup behavior occurs if you have enabled device backups to Google Drive.</p>
<h3>B. Anonymous Purchase Data</h3>
<p>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage in-app purchases. When you make a purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>RevenueCat generates a random, anonymous User ID.</li>
<li>We receive a confirmation that &quot;Anonymous User X purchased Lifetime Access.&quot;</li>
<li>We <strong>cannot</strong> link this purchase to your real identity, email, or physical location.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
<p>The App may request access to certain device features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used strictly to allow you to take photos for your checklists.</li>
<li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> Used to save or retrieve checklist verification photos.</li>
<li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Used <strong>only</strong> if you choose to record an audio note in the Journal.</li>
<li><strong>FaceID/Biometrics:</strong> Used to lock the app locally. We never receive your biometric data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following trusted third-party services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For processing purchase receipts (Privacy standards compliant).</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>Since your data is stored locally, it is as secure as your device. We recommend using a device passcode and enabling the &quot;Privacy Vault&quot; feature within the App for extra security.</p>
<h2>6. Children&#39;s Privacy</h2>
<p>PeacePoint is not intended for children under the age of 4. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>
<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date at the top of this policy.</p>
<h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
